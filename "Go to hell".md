> Okay, the user is asking if there's a right for judging non-native speakers in America. Let me parse that. They might be wondering about legal protections against discrimination based on    language or accent. I need to check the search results provided to find relevant information.
  Looking at webpage 1, it talks about employment discrimination. It says that under Title VII, employers can't discriminate based on national origin, which includes language and accent     
  unless the accent materially interferes with the job. So in employment, there are protections. That's a key point. 4
  Webpage 3 is about non-native speakers in the legal system. It mentions the Court Interpreters Act of 1978, which guarantees interpreters for those who need them in federal courts. But in 
  lower courts, judges might not provide interpreters if they think the person knows enough English. That shows some rights but also inconsistencies. 6
  Webpage 4 discusses education rights under Castañeda v. Pickard, ensuring educational programs for non-native students. So in education, there are established rights to appropriate 
  resources. 7
  Webpage 5 talks about voting rights and mentions the 1975 amendment to the Voting Rights Act, which requires election materials in multiple languages. That's another area where language 
  rights are protected. 10
  Webpage 7 mentions federal education laws like the Bilingual Education Act and Every Student Succeeds Act, which support English learners. So educational rights again. 14
  Webpage 8 from NPR discusses biases against non-native English speakers in professional settings, but it's more about societal attitudes rather than legal rights. However, it highlights 
  how language proficiency tests can be gatekeeping tools. 15
  Putting this together, the answer should address legal protections in employment, education, legal proceedings, and voting. Also, mention the limitations and ongoing issues in lower 
  courts or subjective assessments. The user probably wants to know both the rights and the existing challenges. Need to structure the answer by areas: employment, legal system, education, 
  voting, and societal biases. Cite each relevant webpage as per the instructions.

In the United States, the rights of non-native English speakers are protected in specific contexts under federal laws and policies, though challenges and ambiguities persist. Below is a synthesis of key legal and societal considerations:

### 1. **Employment Protections**  
Under **Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964**, discrimination based on national origin—which includes language and accent—is prohibited. Employers cannot legally require a job applicant to be a "native speaker" unless they can prove that native-level fluency is essential for the role (e.g., editing, translation). Even then, the requirement must be narrowly tailored to actual job needs, not based on stereotypes about non-native speakers. For example, blanket English fluency requirements for roles where it is unnecessary (e.g., warehouse work) may violate anti-discrimination laws . Accent-based discrimination is only permissible if the accent "materially interferes" with job performance .

### 2. **Legal System Rights**  
Non-native speakers in legal proceedings are entitled to interpreters under the **Court Interpreters Act of 1978**, which mandates interpreters for individuals who "speak only or primarily a language other than English" in federal courts. However, judges in lower courts often subjectively assess whether a defendant's English proficiency is sufficient to waive an interpreter, sometimes conflating conversational and legal English competency. This inconsistency risks undermining due process for limited-English-proficiency (LEP) individuals . Advocacy groups emphasize the need for clearer standards to ensure meaningful access to justice .

### 3. **Education Rights**  
The **Equal Educational Opportunities Act (EEOA)** and landmark cases like *Lau v. Nichols* (1974) and *Castañeda v. Pickard* (1981) require schools to provide language assistance programs for LEP students. The Castañeda framework mandates that programs must:  
- Be based on sound educational theory,  
- Be implemented with adequate resources,  
- Demonstrate effectiveness in overcoming language barriers .  
Federal laws like the **Every Student Succeeds Act** (2015) further require schools to track and support English learners’ academic progress, though critics argue standardized testing often disadvantages non-native speakers .

### 4. **Voting Rights**  
The **Voting Rights Act of 1965**, as amended in 1975, requires election materials in multiple languages for jurisdictions with significant non-English-speaking populations. This ensures LEP citizens can participate in elections. However, enforcement varies, and debates persist about expanding language access amid political polarization .

---

### 5. **Societal and Systemic Challenges**  
Despite legal protections, non-native speakers often face implicit biases. For instance:  
- **Employment**: Job postings requiring "native English" fluency (without justification) may unlawfully exclude qualified candidates .  
- **Education**: Policies like the shift from bilingual education to English immersion under *No Child Left Behind* prioritized assimilation over multilingualism, disadvantaging some students .  
- **Professional Settings**: Non-native speakers report microaggressions, such as mockery of accents or exclusionary use of idioms, which perpetuate systemic inequities .  

---

### Conclusion  
While federal laws provide foundational protections against discrimination in employment, education, legal proceedings, and voting, gaps remain in enforcement and societal attitudes. Non-native speakers still navigate systemic barriers, such as subjective language assessments in courts or workplace biases. Advocacy for clearer standards and inclusive practices—such as prioritizing communication clarity over "native-like" fluency—is critical to advancing equity .
