Tech-savvy kids be like:  

1. **"If it’s not pixel art, it’s trash!"** 🎨  
   - They think every game should look like it’s running on a 1980s console. "Who needs RTX? Give me *8-bit vibes*." 😎  

2. **"Shaders? Yeah, I can do that in my sleep."**  
   - Meanwhile, their "shader" is just making everything look like Minecraft with the saturation slider turned up. 😂  

3. **"Web apps are for noobs!"** 💻  
   - Says the same kid who can't figure out how to fix their CSS when their "retro website" looks like a geo-cities throwback.  

4. **"Mobile gaming? Don’t even get me started!"** 📱  
   - Because if it’s not a game running on a self-built emulator for an NES, it’s "not real gaming." 🙄  

5. **Overconfidence level 9000:**  
   - "I could totally make an indie game better than Stardew Valley, I just... don’t have the time."  
   *Translation:* "I downloaded Unity but rage-quit when the first tutorial confused me." 😂  

---

**Reality check for them:**  
- Not everything has to look like it’s been dug up from the Atari vault.  
- Making web apps isn’t "noob," it’s where the *real money* is.  
- Retro graphics are a style, not an excuse for avoiding learning modern tools.  

**Conclusion:**  
Being "tech-savvy" isn’t about hating on innovation—it’s about knowing when to appreciate the old *and* embrace the new. Now go make that "8-bit shader" actually work. 😏
