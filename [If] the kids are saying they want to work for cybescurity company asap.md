# [If] The kids are saying they want to work for cybescurity company asap

**"Oh, so now the kids want to work for a cybersecurity company ASAP?"** 😏  

That’s a solid ambition—but let’s get real for a second. Working in **cybersecurity** isn’t just about being tech-savvy; it’s about discipline, integrity, and a whole lot of learning. If they’re serious about this path, here’s what they need to know:

---

### **1. Learn the Basics First**
- **Understand the Foundations:**  
   Cybersecurity isn’t just hacking—it’s about understanding how systems work so you can protect them.  
   - Learn programming languages like Python, C++, or Java.  
   - Get familiar with networking basics (e.g., IP addresses, DNS, firewalls).  
   - Study operating systems like Linux and Windows.  

- **Build Ethical Skills:**  
   - Hacking skills are worthless if they’re not used responsibly. No one hires someone with a shady track record.

---

### **2. Certifications Matter**
If they want to jump into cybersecurity ASAP, they need to get certified. Here are some beginner-friendly certifications to aim for:
- **CompTIA Security+:** A great entry-level cert for learning the fundamentals of cybersecurity.  
- **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH):** For those who want to learn penetration testing.  
- **Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate:** Focused on security operations and monitoring.  

---

### **3. Show Responsibility, Not Just Interest**
- Companies don’t hire people who *just want to hack stuff*. They hire people who can **protect systems** and work responsibly.  
- **Build a Portfolio:**  
   - Show off projects where you’ve identified vulnerabilities ethically (like bug bounties).  
   - Contribute to open-source projects or practice in safe environments like CTFs (Capture the Flag competitions).

### **4. Start Small, Build Up**
No one lands a big cybersecurity job overnight. Here’s a realistic path:  
1. **Learn the skills:** Take online courses (e.g., freeCodeCamp, TryHackMe, Hack The Box).  
2. **Internships or Entry-Level IT Jobs:** Work in IT support, system administration, or networking to understand how systems operate.  
3. **Work Your Way Into Cybersecurity:**  
   - Companies value hands-on experience.  
   - Many cybersecurity professionals start with smaller roles before moving into specialist jobs.  

---

### **5. Be Prepared for Challenges**
Cybersecurity is a high-pressure field. It’s not just cool tech—it’s about constant vigilance, problem-solving, and adapting to new threats. If they want to work in this industry, they need to:  
- Stay curious and keep learning (cybersecurity evolves daily).  
- Be ethical—one bad decision can ruin their reputation.  
- Stay patient—it’s a long-term journey, not a quick shortcut.

### **The Final Message to the Kids**
*“If you really want to work in cybersecurity, don’t just talk about it—start building the skills. Learn the basics, stay ethical, and prove your passion through real work. Companies hire people who protect systems, not people who want to ‘hack’ for fun. Show responsibility, and you might just get there.”*

Cybersecurity is an awesome career path, but only for those who are willing to put in the work and stay on the right side of the law. So, kids—if you’re serious, the grind starts now. 💻✨
