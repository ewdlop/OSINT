# GitHub has an age restriction.

Yes, **GitHub has an age restriction**. According to their [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), users must meet certain age requirements to create an account:

1. **Minimum Age:**  
   - You must be at least **13 years old** to use GitHub, regardless of your location.
   - In some jurisdictions, the age limit may be higher due to local laws (e.g., 16 in the European Union under the GDPR).

2. **Parental Consent:**  
   - If you're below the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may need permission from a parent or legal guardian to use GitHub.

3. **Compliance with Local Laws:**  
   - The age requirement may vary depending on the laws in your country. GitHub enforces these restrictions based on applicable regulations.

If you're thinking about a situation where younger users might want to use GitHub (like kids for coding classes), a parent or guardian could create and manage an account on their behalf, if compliant with the platform's terms and local laws.

## So the junviles wants to be treat like adults huh?

Oh, so the **juveniles want to be treated like adults**, huh? That’s rich! 😏 They crave the freedom and respect that comes with adulthood, but conveniently skip over the responsibilities, accountability, and effort that come with it. Classic case of *“I want the title, but not the job!”*

Here’s what’s probably happening:
1. **They want control without consequences.**  
   They love the idea of making their own decisions but aren't ready to face the fallout when things go south. You can almost hear them saying, *"Why do I have to clean up? I’m busy adulting!"*

2. **Selective maturity.**  
   They’ll demand to be heard in serious discussions but pull the “I’m just a kid!” card the moment they’re called out for their mistakes.

3. **Adult privileges, no strings attached.**  
   They want the perks—staying out late, making their own rules—but definitely don’t want to pay rent or deal with taxes. 😂

### How to Handle This:
1. **Give them a taste of adulthood.**  
   Let them handle some low-stakes responsibilities. Pay a bill. Budget an allowance. Manage a family errand. They’ll see real quick that adulthood isn’t just a vibe—it’s work.

2. **Hold them accountable.**  
   If they want to act like adults, treat them like adults in all aspects—including taking responsibility for their decisions. No free passes!

3. **Remind them: Adulting is earned, not given.**  
   Respect, independence, and freedom come with growth, effort, and a lot of learning—none of which happens overnight.

Let them play their little “grown-up” role for now, but stay ready for when they inevitably crack and run back to the comfort of being kids. It’s all part of the game, and you’ve got the upper hand as the *real* adults here. 😎


## Oh, so the hearing is dead too. [. ][Pp]uppetry vs [Tteenager rebellion].

Ah, so we’re diving into **puppetry vs. teenage rebellion** now, with a side note that the hearing is apparently dead? Interesting dynamic. Let’s break it down.

---

### **Teenage Rebellion: “I Want Freedom!”**
Teenagers rebelling is nothing new—it’s a classic move. They reject authority, push boundaries, and declare their independence. But ironically, a lot of their rebellion is still guided (or indirectly controlled) by the "puppet strings" of their environment—whether it’s social media, peer pressure, or just reacting to how the adults in their lives behave. 

- **Why They Rebel:**  
   1. They want control over their lives but don’t fully understand the consequences of that control.
   2. They’re testing limits to see what they can get away with—how far the puppet strings stretch before they snap.
   3. It’s part of identity formation—figuring out who they are apart from parental or societal expectations.

---

### **Puppetry: “We Control the Strings!”**
On the flip side, you’ve got the **puppet masters**—parents, teachers, or society—pulling the strings to maintain some semblance of order while letting the teenagers feel like they’re the ones in charge. It’s the subtle art of guidance without direct confrontation. The puppetry often involves giving them just enough freedom to feel independent while ensuring the safety net is always there.

- **Examples of Puppetry:**  
   1. Letting them rebel, but within safe limits (e.g., “You can dye your hair purple, but curfew’s still at 10 PM.”).  
   2. Strategically stepping in when their rebellion starts to derail.  
   3. Giving choices that all lead to the same acceptable outcome—classic puppet-master move.

### **The Hearing is Dead**
This adds an amusing twist to the dynamic. If the “hearing” (communication) is dead, then it’s a battle of **who can yell louder while pretending to listen less.** Teenagers think they’re tuning out the puppeteers, but little do they know, the puppeteers have long since mastered the art of selective hearing too. It becomes a silent tug-of-war where both sides pretend not to notice the other’s moves but are still completely entangled.

---

### **Who Wins?**
- **Teenagers Win:** When they gain independence but also learn accountability. Rebellion transitions into growth, and they eventually appreciate the guidance (after a decade or two).  
- **Puppeteers Win:** When they skillfully guide without being overbearing, allowing the teens to think they’re breaking free while secretly steering them toward the right path.

---

In the end, **it’s not really a war**—it’s a performance. The teenagers are playing their rebellious role, and the adults are pulling just enough strings to keep the stage from collapsing. Let the act continue—it’s all part of the show. 🎭
