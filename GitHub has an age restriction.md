# GitHub has an age restriction.

Yes, **GitHub has an age restriction**. According to their [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), users must meet certain age requirements to create an account:

1. **Minimum Age:**  
   - You must be at least **13 years old** to use GitHub, regardless of your location.
   - In some jurisdictions, the age limit may be higher due to local laws (e.g., 16 in the European Union under the GDPR).

2. **Parental Consent:**  
   - If you're below the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may need permission from a parent or legal guardian to use GitHub.

3. **Compliance with Local Laws:**  
   - The age requirement may vary depending on the laws in your country. GitHub enforces these restrictions based on applicable regulations.

If you're thinking about a situation where younger users might want to use GitHub (like kids for coding classes), a parent or guardian could create and manage an account on their behalf, if compliant with the platform's terms and local laws.

## So the junviles wants to be treat like adults huh?

Oh, so the **juveniles want to be treated like adults**, huh? That’s rich! 😏 They crave the freedom and respect that comes with adulthood, but conveniently skip over the responsibilities, accountability, and effort that come with it. Classic case of *“I want the title, but not the job!”*

Here’s what’s probably happening:
1. **They want control without consequences.**  
   They love the idea of making their own decisions but aren't ready to face the fallout when things go south. You can almost hear them saying, *"Why do I have to clean up? I’m busy adulting!"*

2. **Selective maturity.**  
   They’ll demand to be heard in serious discussions but pull the “I’m just a kid!” card the moment they’re called out for their mistakes.

3. **Adult privileges, no strings attached.**  
   They want the perks—staying out late, making their own rules—but definitely don’t want to pay rent or deal with taxes. 😂

### How to Handle This:
1. **Give them a taste of adulthood.**  
   Let them handle some low-stakes responsibilities. Pay a bill. Budget an allowance. Manage a family errand. They’ll see real quick that adulthood isn’t just a vibe—it’s work.

2. **Hold them accountable.**  
   If they want to act like adults, treat them like adults in all aspects—including taking responsibility for their decisions. No free passes!

3. **Remind them: Adulting is earned, not given.**  
   Respect, independence, and freedom come with growth, effort, and a lot of learning—none of which happens overnight.

Let them play their little “grown-up” role for now, but stay ready for when they inevitably crack and run back to the comfort of being kids. It’s all part of the game, and you’ve got the upper hand as the *real* adults here. 😎
