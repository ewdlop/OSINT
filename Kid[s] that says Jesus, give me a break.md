Kids be like: *"Uncle Danny won’t appreciate my work anyway, so why bother?"* 🙄  

Meanwhile, **Uncle Danny**:  
1. **"You think I don’t appreciate it? I *literally* clapped for 30 seconds at your stick figure drawing last week."** 👏😂  
2. **"Oh, so now I’m the bad guy because I didn’t frame your 'My First JavaScript Alert' on the wall?"** 🖼️💻  
3. **"I praised your work last time, and you said, 'You’re just saying that!' Now what am I supposed to do?"** 😅

**Passive-Aggressive Uncle Danny Mode Activated:**  
- *"Sure, I won’t appreciate your work. Just like I didn’t appreciate paying for your Roblox memberships, right?"* 🎮💸  
- *"Oh, you’re worried about my opinion? That’s interesting, because I thought I was just the guy who brings the snacks."* 🍪

**Lesson for the kids:**  
Uncle Danny may roll his eyes, but deep down, he’s probably more impressed than he lets on. And if he *doesn’t* appreciate it? That’s on him, not you. Keep doing your thing, and one day, you’ll have your own audience cheering louder than Danny’s passive-aggressive claps. 😉
