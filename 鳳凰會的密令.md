> Dear Columbia University Community,
  As part of our ongoing commitment to safeguarding your personal and Columbia information, the CUIT Security Team wishes to inform you about a growing cybersecurity threat called **Smishing**.
  Recently, we have observed a significant increase in smishing attempts targeting universities. It is important to understand what smishing entails, recognize its warning signs, and adopt protective measures to keep your information safe.
  What is Smishing?
  Smishing (Smishing = SMS + Phishing) is a form of phishing attack that uses SMS (Short Message Service) or text messages to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data. Unlike traditional phishing (which typically occurs through email), smishing leverages text messaging to manipulate recipients into taking harmful actions.
  Rise in Smishing Attacks
  In recent days, we have noticed a significant uptick in smishing attempts targeting many university communities. These attacks often masquerade as legitimate communications from trusted entities, including:  
  University administration 
  Financial institutions
  Delivery services 
  Social media platforms
  Cybercriminals exploit this trust to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or downloading malicious software.
  What to Be Aware Of
  Be vigilant for the following signs of smishing attempts:
  Unexpected Texts: Receiving unsolicited messages from unknown numbers or entities.
  Urgent Language: Messages that create a sense of urgency, such as threats to your account or urgent requests for information.
  Suspicious Links: Texts containing shortened URLs or links that redirect to unfamiliar websites.
  Requests for Personal Information: Messages seeking sensitive details such as passwords, Social Security numbers, or financial information. These texts may also direct you to log in to a website that closely mimics Columbia University’s official site.
  Grammar and Spelling Errors: Poorly written messages with noticeable mistakes can be indicators of fraudulent intent.
  How to Protect Yourself
  Implement the following practices to safeguard against smishing attacks:
  Verify the Sender: Always confirm the legitimacy of the message by contacting the organization directly through official channels.
  **Avoid Clicking Links**: Do not click on links or download attachments from unsolicited or unfamiliar text messages. If you need to visit the website mentioned in a message, manually enter the URL into your web browser's address bar instead of using the provided link.
  Do Not Share Personal Information: Refrain from providing sensitive information via text message. Legitimate organizations will never request such data through SMS.
  Use Security Software: Ensure your mobile device has up-to-date security software to detect and block potential threats.
  Report Suspicious Messages: Send a screenshot of possible Columbia-related smishing text messages to Cybersecurity at **smishing@columbia.edu**.
  Stay Informed and Secure
  Your vigilance is essential in maintaining a secure digital environment for our community. By staying informed about smishing and adopting these protective measures, you contribute to the collective security of Columbia University.
  Thank you for your help and assistance in keeping Columbia University secure!
