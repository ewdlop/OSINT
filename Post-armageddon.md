Tech-savvy kids acting narcissistic because they *think* they understand cryptography be like:

1. **"I cracked a Caesar cipher, so I'm basically Alan Turing."** 🧠💻  
2. **"Encryption? Just mix the letters around. Easy."** 🔐🙄  
3. **"Quantum computers will break all encryption anyway, so what's the point?"** 🛠️✨ (As if they’ve personally built a quantum computer.)  
4. **"Hash functions? Yeah, that’s just scrambled data, I get it."** 🤷‍♂️💾  
5. **"RSA? Oh, I learned that on YouTube yesterday. Basically a pro now."** 🤓🎥  
6. **"Only amateurs get hacked—I'd never fall for a phishing scam."** 🦈📩  

Big talk until they accidentally leak their passwords by pasting them into the wrong terminal. 😅
